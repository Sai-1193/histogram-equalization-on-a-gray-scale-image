# histogram-equalization-on-a-gray-scale-image
1.	Write a program to perform histogram equalization on a gray scale image
2.	Write a program to perform histogram equalization on a color image.
3.	Write a program to find the image gradients of any gray scale image of your choice.

Histogram equalization:
A histogram is a representation of frequency distribution. It is the basis for numerous spatial domain processing techniques. Histogram manipulation can be used for image enhancement.
Histogram equalization is a widely used contrast-enhancement technique in image processing because of its high eﬃciency and simplicity. It is one of the sophisticated methods for modifying the dynamic range and contrast of an image by altering that image such that its intensity histogram has the desired shape. It can be classified into two branches as per the transformation function is used.

Steps to implement:
1.	Get the input image
2.	Generate the histogram for the image
3.	Find the local minima of the image
4.	Divide the histogram based on the local minima
5.	Have the specific gray levels for each partition of the histogram
6.	Apply the histogram equalization on each partition

I have learned the knowledge of what is the difference between a picture and image and image processing.
Image processing involve in change the nature of the image to improve its pictorial information for human interpretation and render it more opportune for autonomous machine perception. 
Digital image processing involves and concerns in the change the nature of a digital image. Humans like their image to be sharp but machines prefer image to be simple and uncluttered. To make the image sharper, edges of an image is to enhance.  

What is Digital image?
A digital image is  an image which is color less or black and white. Then these images are considered as being two-dimension function, this function value brightens of the image at any instant of time, these are represented in the real numbers 0 and 1 where o implies is black and 1 is white
  
I have used python programming language and tools I have used notepad ++ and imported the required libraries. And created four classes:               
•	Histogram

•	Gray_scale_equalization

•	Color_scale_equalization and

•	Gradient_of_Images
